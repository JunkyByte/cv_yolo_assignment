P7. Recognition of Persons with YOLO vX

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the various versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once), a popular real-time object detection system, specifically for the task of person detection in images. This project involves comparing the performance of different (at least 4) YOLO versions from YOLOv5. Key aspects of the evaluation will include training and inference times, accuracy, and the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets. A significant part of this project will involve fine-tuning the chosen YOLO models with a dataset focused solely on person detection to ensure the models are well-adapted to the specific task.
